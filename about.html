<h1><u>About my website</u></h1>
<p>I have been learning to code with my uncle (Jonathan), who is a great teacher! He has helped me learn all the steps to creating a website and do basic coding.
This website may seem very random to you, but it is my entry to win a Â£25 amazon voucher!
 In this compitition are my brother and my cousin, they are also doing the coding course with me. I hope you like my website and enjoy looking at what i have created!</p>
